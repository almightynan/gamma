# gamma

**gamma** is a Python-based interface for working with MySQL — designed with students in mind. Think of it like a modern, no-nonsense alternative to WampServer, minus the bloat and compatibility nightmares.

## What is gamma?

gamma offers a lightweight interface to:

- Connect to MySQL databases
- Run SQL commands via CLI
- Visualize tables and schema
- Use AI to generate SQL queries, tables, and more

It’s built to be simple, fast, and student-friendly — no more dealing with missing Visual C++ redistributables or cryptic WAMP issues on school PCs.

> This started as a quick tool for my classmates and myself when we kept running into issues with WAMP. Now it's open source.

## Why Gamma?

- ✅ Minimal setup
- ✅ Built with Python (easy to extend)
- ✅ AI-assisted features for learning and productivity (default username is `nan`; password is `0001`)
- ✅ Compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS
- ✅ Developed by students, for students

## Features

- **Table visualization**  
  Easily browse and inspect your database structure and contents.

- **AI-powered tools**  
  Generate SQL queries, table schemas, and more using AI prompts.

- **Error-resistant design**  
  No more “missing DLL” issues — Gamma avoids common setup failures by not relying on bloated dependencies.

## Who’s it for?

- Students
- Beginners working with MySQL
